 name: Basic US Map
 description: Create basic map visualizations by adding .map() to your Contour instance. Map visualizations require a TopoJSON file with the topology to draw. Wrapping the entire Contour instance in a d3.json() call that reads in a TopoJSON file included with your Contour-Geo download is an easy way to include this data. Then, use configuration options to set properties of the map. Using .USMap() is a shorthand for configuring a .map() visualization that is focused on the US.
